        These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek
        out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. We need to neutralize the homing
        signal. Each unit has total environmental control, gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, in a protective
        field. Sensors show energy readings in your area. We had a forced chamber explosion in the resonator coil. Field
        strength has increased by 3,000 percent.

        Now what are the possibilities of warp drive? Cmdr Riker's nervous system has been invaded by an unknown
        microorganism. The organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining at the molecular level. That's why the
        transporter's biofilters couldn't extract it. The vertex waves show a K-complex corresponding to an REM state.
        The engineering section's critical. Destruction is imminent. Their robes contain ultritium, highly explosive,
        virtually undetectable by your transporter.

        It indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas emanating triolic waves. The cerebellum, the cerebral cortex,
        the brain stem, the entire nervous system has been depleted of electrochemical energy. Any device like that
        would produce high levels of triolic waves. These walls have undergone some kind of selective molecular
        polarization. I haven't determined if our phaser energy can generate a stable field. We could alter the photons
        with phase discriminators.

        Exceeding reaction chamber thermal limit. We have begun power-supply calibration. Force fields have been
        established on all turbo lifts and crawlways. Computer, run a level-two diagnostic on warp-drive systems.
        Antimatter containment positive. Warp drive within normal parameters. I read an ion trail characteristic of a
        freighter escape pod. The bomb had a molecular-decay detonator. Detecting some unusual fluctuations in subspace
        frequencies.

        Sensors indicate human life forms 30 meters below the planet's surface. Stellar flares are increasing in
        magnitude and frequency. Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar 006, warp seven. There's no evidence of an advanced
        communication network. Total guidance system failure, with less than 24 hours' reserve power. Shield
        effectiveness has been reduced 12 percent. We have covered the area in a spherical pattern which a ship without
        warp drive could cross in the given time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Run a manual sweep of anomalous airborne or electromagnetic readings. Radiation levels in our atmosphere have
        increased by 3,000 percent. Electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts approaching synchronization. What is the
        strength of the ship's deflector shields at maximum output? The wormhole's size and short period would make this
        a local phenomenon. Do you have sufficient data to compile a holographic simulation?
